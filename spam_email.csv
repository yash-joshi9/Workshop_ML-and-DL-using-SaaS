Think I'm kidding?  We earned PRECISELY $26,087.58 in our first 94 days doing JUST that - and we scanned our checks online for you to see them with your own eyes!  We've TWEAKED things a little because WE DON'T WANT you to talk to ANYONE.  WE WANT to talk to people FOR YOU.



if you are ....

VERY BUSY or,

Aren't GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE or,

DON'T WANT to talk to people....



Then let US work FULL TIME for you.  We've helped others....

   Julie P. earned $750 in one week with us

   Jeff A. earned $6500 in 5 weeks with us



And we NOW have an EXACT business plan for you and can tell you EXACTLY what to expect with where you're starting.  No guesswork - we've done it.



And if you DO want to seriously evaluate this, we would be HAPPY to even fly you to Los Angeles at OUR expense to get a closer look!  NO KIDDING!

<P><FONT color=#003300 face=""Verdana, Arial,

Talkington purchased a Tax Lien on a 5 acre parcel for

$300. The owner failed to pay the taxes and forfeited

the 5-acre parcel to Craig Talkington. A short time

later Craig sold that property to one of the neighbors

for $20,000. That's the kind of money that buys new

cars and sends young people to college. Craig didn't

stop at one deal. He later bought a tax lien for only

$17 on a ten acre track, the property owner failed to

pay the taxes, and Craig ended up the property, which

he sold for $4,000. I don't know how much money you

are making right now but these are the kinds of

profits that change peoples lives and solve financial

problems and make things a lot better.

1,"Dear sir,,





My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo

Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South

African Information exchange Johannesburg.

.



Due to the previous war against white farmers in

Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters

to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he

ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all

their farms to his party members and his followers. My

father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman

behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our

country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the

presidnt MUGABE. The presidents supporters invaded my

fathers farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested

him and confiscated all his investment.



Early last year when this victimization of white

farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father

envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all

his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of

Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.

When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a

private security company through the help of his

lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real

contents of the box to the security company, then,

went back home. He registered the box as family

treasure.



While he was still in detention that led to his death

due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South

Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in

Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He

was arrested on the 5th of March last year.

Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of

December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.



Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and

depressing because my fathers lawyer is presently

hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;

though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I

want to relocate to your country for good. Presently,

my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum

permit as a refugee.



I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the

money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of

this country to your country for investment. If you

think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with

me immediately with the  number below . Your

compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated

if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my

country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep

this information to yourself and secret, because I

wouldnt want anything that will expose me, and the

existence of this money.



Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.



Sincerely yours,



STEVEN DUBA (DR).

WET, HORNY AND DIRTY GRANDMAS!



Remember how you lusted after your friend's mum in high

school? She was 46 and you were 15? Remember the time

when she bent over to do her gardening and you saw her

sagging breasts through the v-neck opening of her summer

dress? She was OLD and you LOVED her! All you wanted to

do was FUK that Dirty Old Mole BLUE! You can now! Follow

the link below to see just how OLD & DIRTY these moles are!

",00364.11dba84b95e0471927d1ebc8ff0017ef
1,"It was the Spring of 1979.  



I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school

with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the

cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...



Stealing other kids' lunch money.



No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made

them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,

""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment

was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their

lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 

when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,

I promised to pay them even more the week after that,

if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 

longer.



Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school

started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,

and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 

things on their mind than last year's lunch money.



I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,

and I didn't even get beat up.



Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 

secrets you will ever learn.



First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not

going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when

you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 

grabbing the lifejacket.



Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.

They are looking out for their own money, not yours.



The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and

money managers, will always tell you that the best time to

buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep

your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.

Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is

""NEVER"".  



In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index

fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars

in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:



Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?



Hell no!



You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to

make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 

in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in

the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would

you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  



The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.



If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility

is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see

those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed

by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't

care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long

it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 

money.



What I'm talking about here is day trading.  



My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 

and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 

he makes money. 



The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a

$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 

advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 

certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 

down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  



I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 

amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 

only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.



Society would have you believe that successful trading is 

complicated and requires formal training.  



The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 

strategies to make money.  



Popular media and investment professionals portray successful

trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing

ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell

don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm

to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 

dollars.



They make their money only if you believe two lies:



1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 

person.



2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 

commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 

per trade.



Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,

positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...



The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact

so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend

a few hours of studying.  



After reading over 200 financial books and publications

during the past decade, and after using day trading

to successfully make more than four million dollars in

the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:



** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.



** Anyone can do it.



** It only takes a few hours to learn.



When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become

wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 

Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 

only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through

hard work, knowledge, and determination.



After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 

practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks

brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical

experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling

close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 

formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,

I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 

during those formative trading years I am willing to share

with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from

my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,

secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably

year after year.



The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 

hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within

minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 

shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,

and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 



Average Income of a Day Trader: 

5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year

22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year

35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 

27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 

11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 



After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 

profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 

you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 

win DESPITE the current market weakness. 



Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:



*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.





*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.





*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 

buy them and the exact price to sell them. 





*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 

mistakes beginners make.





*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 

consistently in every market! 





*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 

for great success. 





*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.





*** Make money on the biggest news stories.





*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum

returns. 





*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 

professionals use.





*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 





It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 

Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am

I going to take control of my own financial future, and

start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""



Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some

wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?



With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 

need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 

choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 

lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 

trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 

dollars.



The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 

understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 

trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 

trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your

own financial future.



Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?

His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 

make money in the stock market.  



Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California

coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.



In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading

is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking

for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 

that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't

your kind of game.



But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE

in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then

order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise

to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a

millionaire through successful day trading.



You don't need to know anything about the market, and

anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy

game to win if you know how the pieces move.

1,"Dear User,



Do you ever wish you could easily call people you know in other countries

for up to 85% less than standard call prices?! And then to make these savings

without having to subscribe to any low cost calling service?! We have now

launched a product that does exactly that!



You can now call people in most popular destinations around the world for

only 33 cents per minute! There are no hidden charges, you do not need to

signup, use any credit cards, or pay any extra bills! You can try this

service at no risk and choose to use it with no commitment!



To use this new service, simply dial our access number 1530 927 055 and

once connected, dial the actual international number you wish to call.



For more information and the current list of countries you can call, 

please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/



Example: If you wanted to call a German number 0567 123 124 you would:



1) Dial 1 530 927 055

2) Wait until you connect to our system and hear a message asking you

   to dial the number you wish to call.

3) Dial the full international number starting 00. In this instance 00

   (for international) 49 (country code for Germany) 567 123 124 (their

   number without the initial zero)



You will only pay 33 cents per minute to access our system with no further

charges for any calls you make! You can also use this service to make

cheap international calls from mobiles too! However please check the

costs of calling 1530 numbers from your mobile if you are unsure.



You only ever pay for the cost of calling our access number which will

appear on your normal bill. However any international calls you make will

not appear on your bill, so you only ever pay 33 cents per minute when

using our service!



If calling from a mobile, please ensure that you do not press the green/send

key again after dialling the actual mobile number, or you will be billed

for a second call by your mobile operator.



If you have any questions or wish to contact us for more information, 

please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/ for details.



If you are not interested in reducing your phone bills and would not like to

be informed of any other similar offers from ourselves, please reply to this

message with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject heading. If you have your

email forwarded, please ensure that you unsubscribe from the actual account

email is sent to. We apologise if this message has inconvenienced you in any

way.

If you are fed up of being 'ripped off' by the British government every time you buy your tobacco, then you should visit our website, where you can now buy 4 cartons of cigarettes, or 40 pouches of rolling tobacco from as little as 170 Euros (approx 105 pounds), inclusive of delivery by registered air mail from our office in Spain.  



Why pay more???

1,"Dear Sir/Madam,



I am well confident of your capability to assist me in

a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie

(me and you) I am also believing that you will not

expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about

to establish with you. I have decided to contact you

with greatest delight and personal respect.



Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY

SANKOH

who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE

months ago in my country Sierra Leone.

Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided

in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and

move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and

Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in

Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box

containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two

Million dollars).



This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond

by my FATHER and he have already

decided to use this money for future investment of

the family before his arrest.



Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these

documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my

father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a

Refugee by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire.



Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a

trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this

money from Côte d'Ivoire immediately for investment .

Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to

transfer this fund into your Account, but I will

demand for the following requirement:



(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where

this fund will be transferred to in your country or

another neaarby country where taxation will not

takegreat toll on the money?



(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my

travelling papers after this transfer to enable me

come over to meet you in your country for

theinvestment of this money?



(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable

business venture that would not require much technical

expertise in your country where part of this fund

willbe invested?



Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as

it will enable me to establish a stronger business

relationship with you hence I will like you to be the

general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a

Christian and I will please, want you to handle this

transaction based on the trust I have established

on you.



For your assistance in this transaction, I have

decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the

total amount at the end of this business. The security

of this business is very important to me and as such,

I would like you to keep this business very

confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply.

Thank you and God bless you.



VICTOR SANKOH

withdrawals, equals or exceeds the cumulative total of the designated

monthly premiums from the policy date to the end of the current policy

FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING

FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX

IKOYI-LAGOS.



ATTN:,                  



First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.



We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 



In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.



I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.



We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.

(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.

(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.

(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)



All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.



Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 



Yours faithfully,



Egnr. Femi Daniel.



NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************



Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these

Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be

ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and

you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.



Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and

address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that

slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's

slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.

Check the address again.



Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and

replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.



Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and

replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.



Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and

replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.



Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and

replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This

step is how your own name and address is entered into the

list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,

your own name will go down the list of names until you have

reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The

key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from

you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.



Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out

this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to

as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000

emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings

you make, potentially the greater the number of people who

will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then

make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email

showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.



This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of

this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps

shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as

many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help

those who purchase the Guides from you to send out

emails of their own.



Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.

Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate

reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list

with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.

That might seem to you like a clever move because new

buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But

that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.

What will benefit you most is having people who will send

out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new

buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to

be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by

effectively closing down the program with your name on

top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There

wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver

will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done

the work, and your name has worked its way to further

down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and

earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for

anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't

do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!



You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to

the five people on the list that one of the people will just

take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest

assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you

as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find

new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to

cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list

would rather have you working hard because your effort will

benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send

you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal

by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.

Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.

******END OF SUMMARY************************



=======REST OF MESSAGE======================



With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in

this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary

people who may not have done any internet marketing before.

And the earnings potential is staggering!



READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -

follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a

RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can

afford to buy that new car or home that you have been

looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never

responded to one of these before either. One day though,

something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie

for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple

meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where

you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day

that feeling came over me.



I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing

had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,

Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.

What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and

confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover

your investment and make some good money: making over

half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.

If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct

marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing

via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done

in the future, then the experience you will gain here could

be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing

a new career for you.



= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =



If you want to make serious money, read this message until

you understand it completely and feel confident to follow

through on what it advises.



FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND

YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!



Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,

it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You

are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such

and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period

of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and

the others on the list of five.



===========================================

*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,

and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER

CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:



METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY

===========================================



Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that

you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.

Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%

(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better

but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will

send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only

5,000 each.



Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only

5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also

send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of

those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.

That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.



Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of

125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders

for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each

for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response

is 625 orders for Guide # 4.



Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total

of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125

orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This

may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a

very low response rate with a small number of emails being

sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate

up just slightly.



If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:

$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)



If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:

$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795



If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:

$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100



Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone

or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000

emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see

the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the

amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.



There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide

and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.



METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

===========================================



Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are

Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on

the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start

with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.

For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the

Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.



The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise

you how to get the large number of email addresses that

you need to send the new email containing your name and

address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,

you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to

their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your

name would be further down the list, and their new buyers

will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer

service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.



===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============

The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or

somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks

or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it

is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope

and steal it before it gets to you.



ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.

Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each

Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden

by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of

those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME

of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS

and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the

envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to

mail the envelope.



PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW

FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN

AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL

________________________________________________

YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES



=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1

within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.



=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,

you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If

not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.



Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,

YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and

cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT

TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice

and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can

KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people

are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE

MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS

AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.

There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!

===========================================

A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:

You have just received information that can give you

financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't

wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You

can make more money in the next few weeks and months

than you have ever imagined. Follow the program

EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.



Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you

have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved

others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the

people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more

emails and your name will be on every one of them.

Remember, the more you send out the more potential

buyers you will reach.



IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND

EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!



Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the

Copyright owner assigns to you two important rights:

(1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the

GUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assign

to your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyer

to resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1

is a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It's

free of charge and will give you the tools you need.



The right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES

is reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to

resell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the

internet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution.

YOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR

DISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY.  You may print a copy of the

Guides for your own personal use to enhance your

communication skills.

1,"Hi -



( http://club.4tfox.com )



You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.

And they expect you to listen to them?



Enough.



If you want to make money with your computer, then you should

hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making

a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will

show YOU how to do the same thing.



This business is done completely by internet and email, and you

can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send

an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.



How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.

We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.

But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 

insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,

and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if

you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be

just the thing you are looking for.



This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is

done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,

there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -

meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase

each month also).



Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a

free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you

decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still

have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward

them incredibly well, if they work at it.



To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 

 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 

 information



""Send me a free membership!""



Be sure to include your:

1. First name

2. Last name

3. Email address (if different from above)



We will confirm your position and send you a special report

as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.



If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)

you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,

Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,



You can also go to the web address:

http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService



That's all there's to it.



We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.



Looking forward to hearing from you!



Sincerely, 



Hugh Zou



P.S. After having several negative experiences with network

marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.

This is different - there is value, integrity, and a

REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...

and finally make real money on the internet.



Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the

program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free

membership.

1,"Hi,



I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  

I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 

$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?



In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,

it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...



You've probably heard stories about people making

whopping huge money online, but you thought they 

were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or

boy-geniuses.



Well, grasshopper, think again ...



It's people like you and me that are making the real

money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!



Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time

entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 

companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.



Today small business owners and ordinary folks 

like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 

financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 

work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 

technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.



If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 

you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 

DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?

You might not want their product, but remember that 

thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 

percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 

makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 

guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 

review some numbers ...



If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few

dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one

auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a

couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand

over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN

SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY

at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000

emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.

ZERO!



Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when

hardly anyone sees your ad!



Imagine that you have a decent product with a 

profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 

an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 

in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 

generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 

of work.  



It's that simple ...



All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A

THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.



The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 

matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 

using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 

executive working from an office building in New 

York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 

bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 

it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 

and some basic familiarity with the Internet.



I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 

""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 

started with no money, no product to sell, and only 

the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 

opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 

I bought my own home - with CASH.  



You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.

You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience

whatsoever is required.  



If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that

you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.

So what are you waiting for?!



I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer

YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you

will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.



Here goes ...



Do you have basic experience with the web? 

Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?

Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  

Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 

complete financial freedom?  



If you answer YES to these questions, you could be

making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 

home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 

the 9-5 daily grind!



All you need is ambition and commitment.  This

is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work

to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 

it.



You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  

Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 

how to start your first email campaign and how to

build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 

orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.



Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?



No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot

products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay

starting an Internet business because they have 

nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  

After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 

product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 

not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 

seven days. In fact ...



I personally guarantee that you will start your own 

bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 

the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 

to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 

where else will you find that level of service?!



I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 

your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 

Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 

routine for you to follow with specific, exact 

instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 

example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 

The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 

list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 

very first campaign is ready to go.



As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 

of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 

email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even

include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE

if you order NOW!



Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 

classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 

never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 

on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  

What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 

to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 

you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 

extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 



Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  

I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a

successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:



** THE BULKBOOK

Teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit

bulk emailer.  Secret techniques and tips never

before revealed.

** 600 Email subjects that PULL LIKE CRAZY



** EMAIL LIST MANAGER

** STEALTH MASS MAILER

Software can send up to 50,000 emails an hour automatically.

** ADDRESS ROVER 98 and MACROBOT SEARCH ENGINE ROBOT

Extracts email addresses from databases and search engines

at speeds of over 200,000 per hour.



** WORLDCAST EMAIL VERIFIER

make sure they're valid.



** EBOOK PUBLISHER

you guessed it, bulk email!



** SEVEN MILLION EMAIL ADDRESSES

This huge list will get you started bulking right away.

I harvested these addresses myself, the list is filled

with IMPULSE BUYERS ready to respond to your ads!



If you added up all of the FULL VERSION BULK EMAIL software

included with the BULKBOOK package, it would total over

$499.  I am giving you the whole bundle for only $29.99.

That means there is no other out-of-pocket startup expense

for you.  Nothing else to buy, no reason to waste money on

software that doesn't work.  With this one package, you get 

EVERYTHING YOU NEED to START BULK EMAILING RIGHT AWAY.

1,"Mr.Vincent Nnaji,

 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,

 Lagos,Nigeria.

 Dear Sir,

 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 

On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 

According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.

 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 

This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 

Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 

Thanks and Regards,

 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.

FROM:MR. DESMOND STEVENS



                     URGENT ASSISTANCE. 

YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. 

BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHERS MONEY TO 

 A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. 

AS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE

  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. 

PLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. 

YOURS FAITHFULLY, 

DESMOND STEVENS.

1,"Hi -



( http://club.4tfox.com )



You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.

And they expect you to listen to them?



Enough.



If you want to make money with your computer, then you should

hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making

a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will

show YOU how to do the same thing.



This business is done completely by internet and email, and you

can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send

an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.



How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.

We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.

But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 

insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,

and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if

you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be

just the thing you are looking for.



This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is

done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,

there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -

meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase

each month also).



Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a

free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you

decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still

have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward

them incredibly well, if they work at it.



To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 

 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 

 informtion



""Send me a free membership!""



Be sure to include your:

1. First name

2. Last name

3. Email address (if different from above)



We will confirm your position and send you a special report

as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.



If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)

you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,

Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,



You can also go to the web address:

http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService



That's all there's to it.



We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.



Looking forward to hearing from you!



Sincerely, 



Hugh Zou



P.S. After having several negative experiences with network

marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.

This is different - there is value, integrity, and a

REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...

and finally make real money on the internet.



Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the

program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free

membership.



Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with

""Remove"" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE

DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for

both their consumer and business opportunities.

1,"My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.



I need those houses...



Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 



I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. 



If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com

YOUR KIND ATTN.,







RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.



I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this

mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal

and business ethics, I apologize in advance.



I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I

represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâs estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief

security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the

person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the

advent of a new democratic

dispensation in the country under the leadership of

Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under

severe persecution due to the sensitive position he

held in the last military regime, presently he is

under house arrest restricted only to the confines of

his village.



The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a

business proposal that might be of interest to you. My

client has informed me of the existence of funds

deposited with a security company abroad. This fund

came about as part of security votes that were

allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure

as chief security adviser to the then president. What

happened was that he had part of the funds transferred

from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this

security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal

security outfit of the

then president. But before the purchase could take

place the president died. My client has decided to

keep this for himself as all his properties has been

confisticated by the present regime. But due to his

incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the

change of possession to his benefit.



I have been mandated by my client to source for a

foreign partner that can help him facilitate the

change of possession. The deposit certificate and the

code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in

my possession.



The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand

United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.



I remain most obliged.



Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).

Principal Partner. Owolabi & Associates

1,"Greetings! 



You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing, so no removal is necessary. 



If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 



MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 



MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. 

The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 



HERE'S GOOD NEWS 



There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 



With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 



I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 



To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 



Cordially, 



Mark R Sherman 



P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!
